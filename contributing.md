# Development

`master` is the development branch, so you should be able to contribute by
forking normally.

# Standards

Please follow WordPress [coding standards](https://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Coding_Standards)
including docblocks.

# Authorship

If you author one or many functions, please include an
[@author](http://manual.phpdoc.org/HTMLSmartyConverter/HandS/phpDocumentor/tutorial_tags.author.pkg.html)
in your docblock.

# @since

Though we use a double digit value for the version, all `@since` functions should reflect a 3 digit
value. E.g. `1.0` would use `@since 1.0.0`.
